## goal

You are to implement a RESTful web interface. The choice of framework and stack is yours between .NET (C#) or Java. It has to fulfull the following criteria:

* You should be able to manage persons and their favourite colour using the interface
* The application should be able to read the date from the CSV source, without modifying the source file
* You can identify people with a common favourite colour using the interface

A set of sample data is contained within `sample-input.csv`. The number in the first column represents one of the following colours:

| ID | Farbe |
|---|---|
| 1 | blau |
| 2 | grün |
| 3 | violett |
| 4 | rot |
| 5 | gelb |
| 6 | türkis |
| 7 | weiß |

the return content type is `application/json`. The interface should offer the following endpoints:

**GET** /persons
```json
[{
"id" : 1,
"name" : "Hans",
"lastname": "Müller",
"zipcode" : "67742",
"city" : "Lauterecken",
"color" : "blau"
},{
"id" : 2,
...
}]
```

**GET** /persons/{id}

*HINT*: use the csv line number as your **ID**.
```json
{
"id" : 1,
"name" : "Hans",
"lastname": "Müller",
"zipcode" : "67742",
"city" : "Lauterecken",
"color" : "blau"
}
```

**GET** /persons/color/{color}
```json
[{
"id" : 1,
"name" : "Hans",
"lastname": "Müller",
"zipcode" : "67742",
"city" : "Lauterecken",
"color" : "blau"
},{
"id" : 2,
...
}]
```

## acceptance criteria

1. The csv file is read and represented internally by a suitable model class.
2. File access is done with an interface, so the implementation can be easily replaced for other data sources.
3. The REST interface is implemented according to the above specifications.
4. Data access is done using a dependency injection mechanism
5. Unit tests for the REST interface are available.
6. `sample-input.csv` has not been changed.

## bonus points are awarded for the following
* implement the project with MSBuild in mind for CI using TFS/DevOps when using .NET, or as a Maven/Gradle project in Java
* Implement an additional **POST** /persons to add new people to the dataset
* Add a secondary data source (e.g. database via EF or JPA)
